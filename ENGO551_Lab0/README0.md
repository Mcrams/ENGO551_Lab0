## Lab 0 - ENGO 551 - Mikko Ramos
#### Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

The objective of this lab is to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Git/Github by creating a basic series of webpages from scratch and sharing them on GitHub. The site uses Bootstrap 5 for most of its CSS, but a separate CSS stylesheet is used to customize certain parts of the site, especially for smaller screens.

This lab is divided into 4 separate HTML files, as well as an SCSS file that was converted to a CSS file that contains stylesheet information for the site:

#### index.HTML
This is the website's home page, containing a welcome message and links to other pages on the site.

#### aboutme.HTML
This is a page that has some basic information about myself, sorted as an  HTML table.

#### photos.HTML
This page contains some photos that are responsive to the web page, and change size accordingly with the browser window.

#### contact.HTML
This page contains my contact and social media information, organized in an HTML list.

#### styles.CSS and styles.SCSS
These two documents contain stylesheet information for the website, including:
- Media queries to change the site's background and display a message when the screen is smaller.
- Styling data for the table in the "About Me" section of the site.
- Font styling information for the site's body and table.
